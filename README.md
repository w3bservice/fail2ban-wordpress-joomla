# fail2ban-wordpress-joomla

Add these files to your fail2ban conf directory to start banning script kiddies spamming default joomla & wordpress backrooms or the wordpress xml-rpc security flaw (it can be used to crack the admin password).

You may need to change paths in jail.d/*.conf files, depending on where your apache logs live.

Also included: one-line scripts to preserve your iptables rules across reboots.
